# Notes-ECE391
This is the repo for notes of ECE391 in UIUC.

This notes is not strict, because it was written by a student who attended the course. If you see a similar question in the exam, you should use what’s on the course to answer. I’m not responsible for any of your score, but I’m happy to discuss technical questions on GitHub. Please open an issue if you would like to discuss.

Please again note that this is NOT an oﬃcial study material for ECE391, but something like a helper tool when you learn it. If you ﬁnd anything wrong, please contact me and we can discuss how we can ﬁx it.

Some ﬁgures are taken from Chinese resources so they have Chinese. Please translate them if you would like to. Some ﬁgures are taken from the oﬃcial course materials, please contact me to re-draw or delete them if you’re a course staﬀ and you’ve consulted the professor.
